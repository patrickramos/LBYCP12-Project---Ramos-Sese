#Barcode Scanner

##Features:
- detects barcode then displays the corresponding item with respect to the barcode
- programming language to be used will be JAVA
- library function will be OpenCV and Java.swing, acm.jar

##Flowchart:

##Data Structures to be used:
- dynamic list
- stack

##Main Interest:
Nowadays the use of detection based applications is widely used, it will be interesting developing object detection based programs and applications.

##Significance:
- barcode system has good accuracy
- its speed is reliable since you just point and scan
- the control in the input items or the inventory will be easy because of the dynamic list

##Labor Distribution:
- Graphical User Interface (Patrick Ramos)
- Data Structure Implementation (Miguel Sese)
